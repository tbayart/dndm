**Project has moved**

https://srchub.org/p/dndm/

This is a fork of mydownloader ( http://code.google.com/p/mydownloader/ ). The original project was licensed under GPL but I received special permission to fork under the Apache License.

Here is a list of changes in this fork:

  * Fixed support for FTP
> (The application would crash if you didn't give it a file name when downloading from FTP)
  * Fixed up the parameter support so you can add downloads via the command line
> (This was needed for the following Chrome extension - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downloaders/lfjamigppmepikjlacjdpgjaiojdjhoj - I'm sure an extension exists for Firefox as well where you can use a custom download manager. See the wiki for more information on integration.)
  * Upgraded to VS2010/.Net 3.5
  * Create an installer
  * Fixed cookie support for IE
> (Microsoft randomizes the cookie file names now)
  * Added cookie support for Chrome and Firefox (this can be changed in settings)

Please do note - I will NEVER include malware/greyware/toolbars or any sort of crap in this project, source, or installers.
